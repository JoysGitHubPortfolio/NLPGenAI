Absolutely terrible experience with AXA Health Insurance! They are simply violating policyholder rights and trying to rip customers off. My case is beyond belief – they provided me with an authorization code to see a specialist, which I did as per their referral, only for them to later deny covering the specialist's fees! Their reason for denial? They initially claimed that my policy excess applied, which was completely false. After multiple discussions and follow-ups, they later confirmed that I do not have any excess at all! Despite this, AXA still refuses to pay, forcing me through endless back-and-forth emails and unnecessary paperwork. Each time I contact them, they either ask for yet another letter or drag the issue through their complaints department, making the process unnecessarily long and frustrating. My policy clearly states that I do not have any excess and also that I am entitled to up to £500 for outpatient consultations per each person on my policy per year. It is obvious they are intentionally making claims difficult to avoid paying out what policyholders are rightfully owed. This is completely unethical and unacceptable from a supposedly reputable insurance company. Stay away from AXA Health unless you want to waste time, money, and energy fighting for the coverage you paid for! I will be taking this matter to the Financial Ombudsman and seeking legal advice. I am also thinking of reaching out to BBC Panorama, as everyone in the UK should know how they are dealing with people. AXA, do better!
